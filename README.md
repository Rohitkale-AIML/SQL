# SQL

## Order of execution
- FROM, including JOINs
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- WINDOW functions
- SELECT
- DISTINCT
- UNION
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

## Window Functions
Window fns give the ability to put the values from one row of data into context compared to a group of rows, or partition.

We can answer questions like
- If the dataset were sorted, where would this row land in the results?
- How does a value in this row compare to a value in the prior row?
- How does a value in the current row compare to the average value for its group?

So, window functions return group aggregate calculations alongside individual row-level information for items in that group, or partition. 

## Views vs CTEs

Although there are some differences between them, common table expressions and views seem to perform very similarly. So, when should you use each one?

- **Ad-hoc queries:** For queries that are referenced occasionally (or just once), it’s usually better to use a CTE. If you need the query again, you can just copy the CTE and modify it if necessary.
- **Frequently used queries:** If you tend to reference the same query often, creating a corresponding view is a good idea. However, you’ll need create view permission in your database to create a view.
- **Access management:** A view might be used to restrict particular users’ database access while still allowing them to get the information they need. You can give users access to specific views that query the data they’re allowed to see without exposing the whole database. In such a case, a view provides an additional access layer.

## Unions

- Using a UNION, you can combine any two queries that result in the same number of columns with the same data types.
- The columns must be in the same order in both queries.
- There are many possible use cases for UNION queries, but the syntax is simple: write two queries with the same number and type of fields, and put a UNION keyword between them:
- Let’s say you want to get all the cities from two different tables.

SELECT City FROM Customers

UNION

SELECT City FROM Suppliers

ORDER BY City;

**To retain the duplicate rows**

SELECT City FROM Customers

UNION ALL

SELECT City FROM Suppliers

ORDER BY City;
